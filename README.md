Hello to whoever is reading this, my name is Adam. I am 30 years old and live in California. I currently (soon to be "previously") 
work in manufacturing. I've been a CNC machnist and programmer for a few years, and moved up to Quality Control a little over a year ago.
I recently decided that it was time for a career change, and programming/coding seemed to have the right balance of challanging/interesting.
I just started Harvard's CS50 and I hope that it, as well this readme, are the first steps towards a rewarding career. 5/4/2022
